# üåûfocusAutomation
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏èContext
I was reading a book called "HyperFocus" By - Chris Bailey. In a chapter, Chris advised readers to look into what is occupying their attentional space in order to decide that if they have gone into autopilot mode or not. If yes, then just recall the targets for the time and get into Hyperfocus mode.
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏èAbout the automation
This automation pop-ups a text GUI dialog box every 15-30 minutes after the user logs in to the system and sends a notification to the user asking about his attentional space and the user has to write the answer in the GUI dialog box and press save and close the window. This automation then saves the data with time and date to a file on your machine which you can lookat later and decide how often you slip into autopilot mode.
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏èReason of making focusAutomation
It is a hard task remembering to look into your attentional space after some time. So I thought why not automate it.
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏èHow it can help you?
It will remind you to look into your attentional space and decide if you have slipped into autopilot mode and get into hyperfocus mode ASAP.
